# SQL
This project involved an in-depth analysis of a toy store chain's sales data using SQL Server. By cleaning and transforming data from sales, products, stores, and inventory tables, I ensured data accuracy and consistency. I applied complex SQL queries to identify top-performing stores and analyze sales trends, and evaluate inventory turnover.
